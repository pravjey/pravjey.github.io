# Ecoli Dataset

This project was a coursework assignment for a module in Machine Learning, rather than one that I chose out of personal interest. I also had no domain knowledge of the subject, apart from the description file provided. The purpose of this project was to identify the most important features and the maximum number of features to achieve an accurate classification and evaluate the resultant decision tree.

This project can be split into three stages: Data Cleaning, Feature Selection and Model Evaluation. The program was written using Python and the following libraries were used:

	*	matplotlib
	
	*	mpl_toolkits.mplot3d	
	
	*	pandas
	
	*	sklearn
	
	*	tabulate
	
	*	time

I have written two blog posts on this project:

	1. [Cleaning the Ecoli Dataset using Python](https://pravinjeyaraj.wordpress.com/2019/05/04/cleaning-the-ecoli-dataset-using-python/ )

	2. [Feature Selection in the Ecoli Dataset](https://pravinjeyaraj.wordpress.com/2019/10/23/feature-selection-in-the-ecoli-dataset/ ) 
	
		The ranking of the features in terms of importance and evaluating the accuracy of the model after using a certain number of features.
